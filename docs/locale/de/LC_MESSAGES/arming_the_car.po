"A car without sensor modules is unarmed just like a man without sight and"
" hearing, thus he has no feeling for the surrounding environment. So what"
" we are going to do is arm the car, allowing it to detect the "
"surroundings. Now let’s turn the **PiCar** into the **PiCar-S**."

"What exactly is the PiCar-S? ------- We arm the PiCar with some sensors, "
"which endow the car with the ability to collect and process the data. The"
" **sensor modules** to the **PiCar** is what the **cartridges** to the "
"**game console**; they are added to the basic design of the game and thus"
" richening the play. It’s also similar to the code. The processor will "
"use *SunFounder_PiCar* to drive the car’s movement, and call the "
"corresponding code package for different modules "
"(**SunFounder_Light_Follower**, **SunFounder_Line_Follower**, "
"**SunFounder_Ultrasonic_Avoidance**)."
